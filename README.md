# [postcss.parts](http://postcss.parts)

A searchable catalog of PostCSS plugins, built using React.js and untilising the Flux application architecture.

## Adding a plugin

This app now pulls data from [postcss-plugins](https://github.com/himynameisdave/postcss-plugins), which will hopefully serve as more centralized list of all PostCSS plugins in the future. You can [head over here](https://github.com/himynameisdave/postcss-plugins#submitting-a-new-plugin) to walk through the easy steps to add a plugin.

Also, you could contact [@mxstbr](https://twitter.com/mxstbr) or [@himynamisdave](https://twitter.com/dave_lunny) on Twitter about getting your plugin added.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo using `git clone git@github.com:mxstbr/postcss.parts`

2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

3. Run `grunt` to start the local web server.

4. Go to `http://localhost:8000` and you should see the app running!

If you change something in the JavaScript or CSS files, they get compiled and minified automatically on save. Simply look at your browser and you should see the changes you made!
